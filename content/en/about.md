Hello everyone, I'm Emilio, a Computer Engineering student with a few years of work experience in programming and also in database administration and its development through Oracle PL/SQL, I was programming Backend for the DAM final degree project and for a company.

My studies are: Bachelor of Science, and DAM (Multiplatform Application Development is a higher professional training aimed at general programming). After taking those academic courses I studied and researched extensively on my own (because I love computing, especially programming and security [Scripting, administration, OSINT, and BlueTeam]). I will try to explain and apply these technologies through guides in this blog, feel free to see the entire blog ðŸ˜Š.

Afterwards I worked for a subcontractor of a telecommunications company here in Spain, focusing mainly on scripting for administration and management, using Python and other technologies I was able to, for example:
- Create a script that produced a report using MatPlotLib graphs dynamically generated through requests to the ticket backend they used there.
- Create multiple automation scripts using libraries such as Selenium, etc.
- In one use case I needed to automate a set of cases that had to be interpreted using a library that obtained the data from the backend that came from the email pdf and managed the case correctly (writing a description, archiving the information, etc.).

In my free time I usually continually investigate my resources, technologies and systems used in my daily life, trying to optimize them (normally by lowering the cost) or replace them with alternatives that guarantee greater security and privacy. These types of alternatives and investigations are what I will try to explain in detail in this blog, specifying as much as possible and the reason for their adoption. For example:
- Using Syncthing as a decentralized alternative to Onedrive.
- Using Linux as an alternative to Windows to get more out of my computers and make the most of them.
- Using proxies and VPS to bypass firewalls.
- Using the domain of this page to use different technologies to create a brand on the internet safely.

My favorite programming languages â€‹â€‹are: Java, Rust, Python, Go, C#, in that order.

My favorite operating systems are: Debian, EndeavourOS (Linux distribution based on Arch) and Windows 10, in that order.

If you need to know what other technologies I use, feel free to check out my Linkedin and Github (at the bottom of the page), as well as contact me via email [contactar@emilio.red](mailto:contactar@emilio.red), if you need to encrypt the content of the message you have my public key also at the bottom of the page or at [pgp.emilio.red](pgp.emilio.red).

Contact me using MÃ¡stodon if you want to follow me or have conversations outside of the work environment.

I hope you liked it and I urge you to read the rest of the blog entries where I will be putting the technologies I use and research in more detail, as well as my Github to keep up to date with my projects.

**There are many technologies that I have not talked about to be concise with the presentation, to know more about me check out my social networks or contact me.**
